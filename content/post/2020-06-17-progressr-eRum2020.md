I am grateful for everyone involved who made e-Rum 2020 possible.  I cannot imagine having to cancel the on-site Milano conference that had planned for more than a year and then start over to re-organize and create a fabulous online experience for ~1,500 participants in such short notice. Your contribution to the R Community in these times is invaluable - thank you soo much.

As a speaker, I found it a bit of a challenge. It was my first presentation at an all online conference, so I wasn't sure what to expect and how it would go. As others said, it is indeed a bit unusual to present to an audience you know is there but that you cannot see or interact with during the talk. I gave my presentation a bit before seven o'clock in the morning my time, and halfway through, my mind tried to convince me that it would be ok to get up and pour myself another cup of coffee - hehe - I certainly did not expect that one.

Now, let's make some progress in this world!

\- Henrik
