Today, its been 20 years since Martin MÃ¤chler started the [R-help community list](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/). The [first post](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/1997-April/001488.html) was written by Ross Ihaka on 1997-04-01:

This is a post about R's memory model. We're talking [R v0.50 beta](https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-0/). I think that the paragraph at the end provides a nice anecdote on the importance not to be overwhelmed by problems ahead:

>  "(The consumption of one cell per string is perhaps the major memory problem in R - we didn't design it with large problems in mind. It is probably fixable, but it will mean a lot of work)."

We all know the story; an endless number of hours has been put in by many contributors throughout the years, making The R Project and its community the great experience it is today.

Thank you!

PS. This is a blog version of my [R-help post](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2017-April/445921.html) with the same content.
