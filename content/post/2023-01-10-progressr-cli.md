**[progressr]** 0.13.0 is on CRAN.  In the recent releases,
**progressr** gained support for using **[cli]** to generate progress
bars.  Vice versa, **cli** can now report on progress via the
**progressr** framework.  Here are the details.  For other updates to
**progressr**, see [NEWS].

The **progressr** package, part of the [futureverse], provides a
minimal API for reporting progress updates in R. The design is to
separate the representation of progress updates from how they are
presented. What type of progress to signal is controlled by the
developer. How these progress updates are rendered is controlled by
the end user. For instance, some users may prefer visual feedback,
such as a horizontal progress bar in the terminal, whereas others may
prefer auditory feedback.  The **progressr** package works also when
processing R in parallel or
distributed using the **[future]** framework.  



## Use 'cli' progress bars for 'progressr' reporting

In **progressr** (>= 0.12.0) [2022-12-13], you can report on progress
using **cli** progress bar. To do this, just set:

```r
progressr::handlers(global = TRUE)  ## automatically report on progress
progressr::handlers("cli")          ## ... using a 'cli' progress bar
```

With these globals settings (e.g. in your `~/.Rprofile` file; see
below), R reports progress as:

```r
library(progressr)
y <- slow_sum(1:10)
```

Just like regular **cli** progress bars, you can customize these in
the same way.  For instance, if you use the following from one of the
**cli** examples:

```r
options(cli.progress_bar_style = list(
  complete = cli::col_yellow("\u2605"),
  incomplete = cli::col_grey("\u00b7")
))
```

you'll get:

## Configure 'cli' to Report Progress via 'progressr'

You might have heard that **[purrr]** recently gained support for
reporting on progress.  If you didn't, you can read about it in the
tidyverse blog post '[purrr 1.0.0]' on 2022-12-20.  The gist is to
pass `.progress = TRUE` to the **purrr** function of interest, and
it'll show a progress bar while it runs.  For example, assume we the
following slow function for calculating the square root:

```r
slow_sqrt <- function(x) { Sys.sleep(0.1); sqrt(x) }
```

If we call

```r
y <- purrr::map(1:30, slow_sqrt, .progress = TRUE)
```

we'll see a progress bar appearing after about two seconds:

![Animation of a one-line, green-blocks cli progress bar in the terminal growing from 0% to 100% with an ETA estimate at the end](/post/handler_cli-default.svg)

This progress bar is produced by the **cli** package.  Now, the neat
thing with the **cli** package is that you can tell it to pass on the
progress reporting to another progress framework, including that of
the **progressr** package.  To do this, set the R option:

```r
options(cli.progress_handlers = "progressr")
```

This causes _all_ **cli** progress updates to be reported via
**progressr**, so if you, for instance, already have set:

```r
progressr::handlers(global = TRUE)
red_heart <- cli::col_red(cli::symbol$heart)
handlers(handler_txtprogressbar(char = red_heart))
```

the above `purrr::map()` call will report on progress in the terminal
using a classical R progress bar tweaked to use red hearts to fill the
bar;

![Animation of a one-line, text-based red-hearts progress bar in the terminal growing from 0% to 100%](/post/handler_txtprogressbar-custom-hearts.svg)


As another example, if you set:

```r
progressr::handlers(global = TRUE)
progressr::handlers(c("beepr", "cli", "rstudio"))
```

R will report progress _concurrently_ via audio using different
**[beepr]** sounds, via the terminal as a **cli** progress bar, and
the RStudio's built-in progress bar - whenever progress is reported
via the **progressr** framework _or_ the **cli** framework.


## Customize progress reporting when R starts

To safely configure the above for all your _interactive_ R sessions, I
recommend adding something like the following to your `~/.Rprofile`
file (or in a standalone file using the **[startup]** package):

```r
if (interactive() && requireNamespace("progressr", quietly = TRUE)) {
  ## progressr reporting without need for with_progress()
  progressr::handlers(global = TRUE)

  ## Use 'cli', if installed ...
  if (requireNamespace("cli", quietly = TRUE)) {
    progressr::handlers("cli")
    ## Hand over all 'cli' progress reporting to 'progressr'
    options(cli.progress_handlers = "progressr")
  } else {
    ## ... otherwise use the one that comes with R
    progressr::handlers("txtprogressbar")
  }
  
  ## Use 'beepr', if installed ...
  if (requireNamespace("beepr", quietly = TRUE)) {
    progressr::handlers("beepr", append = TRUE)
  }
  
  ## Reporting via RStudio, if running in the RStudio Console,
  ## but not the terminal
  if ((Sys.getenv("RSTUDIO") == "1") && 
      !nzchar(Sys.getenv("RSTUDIO_TERM"))) {
    progressr::handlers("rstudio", append = TRUE)
  }
}
```

See the **[progressr]** website for other, additional ways of
reporting on progress.


Now, go make some progress!
