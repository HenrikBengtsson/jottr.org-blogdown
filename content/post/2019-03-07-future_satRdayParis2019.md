Below are links to my slides from my talk on _Future: Friendly Parallel Processing in R for Everyone_ that I presented last month at the [satRday Paris 2019](https://paris2019.satrdays.org/) conference in Paris, France (February 23, 2019).


My talk (32 slides; ~40 minutes):

* Title: _Future: Friendly Parallel Processing in R for Everyone_
* [HTML](https://www.jottr.org/presentations/satRdayParis2019/BengtssonH_20190223-SatRdayParis2019.html) (incremental slides; requires online access)

A big shout out to the organizers, all the volunteers, and everyone else for making it a great satRday.
