Below are the slides for my _Future: Simple Async, Parallel & Distributed Processing in R Why and What’s New?_ talk that I presented at the rstudio::conf 2020 conference in San Francisco, USA on January 27-30, 2020.


My talk (17 slides; ~18+2 minutes):

* Title: _Future: Simple Async, Parallel & Distributed Processing in R Why and What’s New?_

A big thank you goes out to Dan LaBar (<a href="https://twitter.com/embiggenData">@embiggenData</a>) for proposing the original design of the future hex sticker. All credits to him and his work. You can blame me for the tweaked background.

Thank you to [RStudio, PBC](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/01/29/rstudio-pbc), for the invitation to speak at the [rstudio::conf 2020](https://rstudio.com/conference/) conference.  A huge thank you to everyone contributing to the conference - organizers, staff, speakers, poster presenters, and last but not the least, all the wonderful participants.  Each one of you makes our R community what it is today.
