Happy New Year!  I made some updates to the future framework during
2021 that involves overall improvements and essential preparations to
make it possible to go forward with some exciting new features that
I'm keen to work on during 2022.

The [future framework](https://futureverse.org) makes it easy to
parallelize existing R code - often with only a minor change of
code. The goal is to lower the barriers so that anyone can quickly and
safely speed up their existing R code in a worry-free manner.

**[future]** 1.22.1 was released in August 2021 followed by **future**
1.23.0 at the end of October 2021.  Below is a summary of the updates
that came with those two releases:

 * [New features](#new-features)
 * [Performance improvements](#performance-improvements)
 * [Cleanups to make room for new features](#cleanups-to-make-room-for-new-features)
 * [Significant changes preparing for the future](#significant-changes-preparing-for-the-future)
 * [Roadmap ahead](#roadmap-ahead)
 
There were also several updates to the related **[parallelly]** and
**[progressr]** packages, which you can read about in earlier blog
posts under the [#parallelly](/tags/#parallelly-list) and
[#progressr](/tags/#progressr-list) tags.


## New features

### futureSessionInfo() for troubleshooting and issue reporting

Function [`futureSessionInfo()`] was added to **future** 1.22.0.  It
outputs information useful for troubleshooting problems related to the
future framework.  It also runs some basic tests to validate that the
current future backend works as expected.  If you have problems
getting futures work on your machine, please run this function before
reporting issues at [Future Discussions].  Here's an example:

```r
> library(future)
> plan(multisession, workers = 2)
> futureSessionInfo()

### Working around UTF-8 escaping on MS Windows

Due to limitations in R itself, UTF-8 symbols outputted on MS Windows
parallel workers would be [relayed as escaped
symbols](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future/issues/473) when
using futures.  Now, the future framework, and more specifically
[`value()`], attempts to recover such MS Windows output to UTF-8 before
outputting it.

For example, in **future** (< 1.23.0) you would get the following:

```r
f <- future({ cat("\u2713 Everything is OK") ; 42 })
v <- value(f)
#> <U+2713> Everything is OK
```

when, and only when, those futures are resolved on a MS Windows
machine.  In **future** (>= 1.23.0), we work around this problem by
looking for `<U+NNNN>` like patterns in the output and decode them as
UTF-8 symbols;

```r
f <- future({ cat("\u2713 Everything is OK") ; 42 })
v <- value(f)
#> âœ“ Everything is OK
```

_Comment_: From [R 4.2.0, R will have native support for UTF-8 also on
MS
Windows](https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2021/12/07/upcoming-changes-in-r-4.2-on-windows/index.html).
More testing and validation is needed to confirm this will work out of
the box in R (>= 4.2.0) when running R in the terminal, in the R GUI,
in the RStudio Console, and so on.  If so, **future** will be updated
to only apply this workaround for R (< 4.2.0).



### Harmonization of future(), futureAssign(), and futureCall()

Prior to **future** 1.22.0, argument `seed` for [`futureAssign()`] and
[`futureCall()`] defaulted to `TRUE`, whereas it defaulted to `FALSE`
for [`future()`].  This was an oversight.  In **future** (>= 1.22.0),
`seed = FALSE` is the default for all these functions.


### Protecting against non-exportable results

Analogously to how globals may be scanned for ["non-exportable"
objects](https://future.futureverse.org/articles/future-4-non-exportable-objects.html)
when option `future.globals.onReference` is set to `"error"` or
`"warning"`, `value()` will now check for similar problems in the
value returned from parallel workers.  For example, in **future** (<
1.23.0) we would get:

```r
library(future)
plan(multisession, workers = 2)
options(future.globals.onReference = "error")

f <- future(xml2::read_xml("<body></body>"))
v <- value(f)
print(v)
#> Error in doc_type(x) : external pointer is not valid
```

whereas in **future** (>= 1.23.0) we get:

```r
library(future)
plan(multisession, workers = 2)
options(future.globals.onReference = "error")

f <- future(xml2::read_xml("<body></body>"))
v <- value(f)
#> Error: Detected a non-exportable reference ('externalptr') in the value
#> (of class 'xml_document') of the resolved futur
```


### Finer control what type of conditions are captured and replayed

In addition to specify which condition classes to be captured and
relayed, in **future** (>= 1.22.0), it is possible to also specify
condition classes to be ignored.  For example,

```r
f <- future(..., conditions = structure("condition", exclude = "message"))
```

captures all conditions but message conditions.  The default is
`conditions = "condition"`, which captures and relayes all types of
conditions.



## Performance improvements

I always prioritize correctness over performance in the **future**
framework.  So, whenever optimizing for performance, one always have
to make sure we are not breaking things somewhere else.  Thankfully,
there are now [more than 200 reverse-dependency packages on
CRAN](https://www.futureverse.org/statistics.html) and Bioconductor
that I can validate against.  They provide another comfy cushion
against mistakes than what we already get from package unit tests and
the **[future.tests]** test suite.


### Less latency for multicore, multisession, and cluster futures

In **future** 1.22.0, the default timeout of [`resolved()`] was
decreased from 0.20 seconds to 0.01 seconds for multicore,
multisession, and cluster futures.  This means that less time is spent
checking and waiting for results from these type of future backends
when results are not yet available.  If possible, that is, after
making sure it's safe to do so, we might decrease the default timeout
to zero seconds in a later release.


### Less overhead when initiating futures

The overhead of initiating futures was significantly reduced in
**future** 1.22.0.  For example, the roundtrip time for
`value(future(NULL))` is about twice as fast for sequential, cluster,
and multisession futures.  For multicore futures the roundtrip speedup
is about 20%.

The speedup comes from pre-compiling the R expression that will be
used to resolve the future expression into R expression templates
which then can quickly re-compiled. Specifically, instead of calling
`expr <- base::bquote(tmpl)` (slow) for each future, we take a
two-step approach where `tmpl_cmp <- bquote_compile(tmpl)` (slow)
only has to be called once per session such that we only have to use
`expr <- bquote_apply(tmpl_cmp)` (quick) for each future.(*) This
pre-compile approach speeds up the construction of the final future
expression from the original future expression by ~10 times, compared
to when re-building them each time a future is created.

(*) These are [internal functions](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future/blob/develop/R/000.bquote.R)
of the **future** package.


### Environment variables are only used when package is loaded

All R [options specific to the future
framework](https://future.futureverse.org/reference/future.options.html)
have defaults that fall back to corresponding environment variables.
For example, the default for option `future.rng.onMisuse` can be set
by environment variable `R_FUTURE_RNG_ONMISUSE`.

The purpose of the environment variables is to make it possible to
configure the future framework before launching R, e.g. in shell
startup scripts, or in shell scripts submitted to job schedulers in
high-performance compute (HPC) environments.  When R is already
running, the best practice is to use the R options to configure the
future framework.

In order to avoid the overhead from querying and parsing environment
variables at runtime, but also to clarify how and when environment
variables should be set, starting with **future** 1.22.0,
_`R_FUTURE_*` environment variables are only used when the **future**
package is loaded_.  Then, if set, they are used to set the
corresponding `future.*` option.


## Cleanups to make room for new features

The `values()` function is defunct since **future** 1.23.0 in favor of
`value()`.  All CRAN and Bioconductor packages that depend on
**future** has been updated since a long time.  If you get the error:

```r
Error: values() is defunct in future (>= 1.20.0). Use value() instead.
```

make sure to update your R packages.  A few users of **[furrr]** have
run into this error - updating to **furrr** (>= 0.2.0) solved the
problem.


Continuing, to further harmonize how the Future API is used, we are
moving away from odds-and-ends features.  The goal is to make sure
that _all_ code using futures should be sharable and be able to run
everywhere, not just on a particular parallel backend that the
developer choose to work with.  This will also allow us to add new
features, e.g. being able to queue up futures to be resolved on
whatever local or remote computational resource that are currently
available.  In this spirit, we are slowly moving away from
"persistent" workers for cluster-based futures.

For example, in **future** (>= 1.23.0), `plan(multisession, persistent
= TRUE)` is no longer supported and will produce an error if
attempted.  The same will eventually happen also for `plan(cluster,
persistent = TRUE)`, but not until we have [support for caching
"sticky" globals](https://www.futureverse.org/roadmap.html), which is
the main use cases for persistent workers.

Another example is, transparent futures, are deprecated in **future**
(>= 1.23.0).  If used, `plan(transparent)` produces a warning.  In a
later release, it will produce an error.  Transparent futures were
added during the early days in order to simplify troubleshooting of
futures.  A better approach these days is to use `plan(sequential,
split = TRUE)`, which makes interactive troubleshooting tools such as
`browser() and `debug()` to work.



## Significant changes preparing for the future

Prior to **future** 1.22.0, lazy futures where assigned to the
currently set future backend immediately when created.  For example,
if we do:

```r
library(future)
plan(multisession, workers = 2)

f <- future(42, lazy = TRUE)
```

with **future** (< 1.22.0), we would get:

```r
class(f)
#> [1] "MultisessionFuture" "ClusterFuture"      "MultiprocessFuture"
#> [4] "Future"             "environment" 
```

Starting with **future** 1.22.0, lazy futures remain generic futures
until they are launched, which means they are not assigned a backend
class until they have to.  Now, the above example gives:

```r
class(f)
#> [1] "Future"      "environment"
```

This change opens up the door for storing futures themselves to file
and sending them elsewhere. More precisely, this means we can start
working torwards a _queue of futures_, which then can be processed on
whatever compute resources we have access to at the moment, e.g. some
futures might be resolved on the local computer, others on machines on
a local cluster, and when those fill up, we can burst out to cloud
resources, or maybe process them via a community-driven peer-to-peer
cluster.


## Roadmap ahead

There are lots of new features on the roadmap and I hope to be able to
make significant progress on many of them during 2022.  If you're
curious on what's coming up, see
