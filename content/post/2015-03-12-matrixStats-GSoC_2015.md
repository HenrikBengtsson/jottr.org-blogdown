We are pleased to announce our proposal '**[Subsetted and parallel computations in matrixStats]**' for Google Summer of Code.  The project is aimed for a student with experience in R and C, it runs for three months, and the student gets paid 5500 USD by Google.  Students from (almost) all over the world can apply.  Application deadline is **March 27, 2015**.  I, Henrik Bengtsson, and HÃ©ctor Corrada Bravo will be joint mentors.  Communication and mentoring will occur online.  We're looking forward to your application.
