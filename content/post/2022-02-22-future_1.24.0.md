**[future]** 1.24.0 is on CRAN.  It comes with one significant update, a small improvement to `plan()` and `tweaks()`, and further deprecation of legacy future strategies.  Below are the most important changes.


## future(..., seed = TRUE) updates RNG state

In **future** (< 1.24.0), using [`future(..., seed = TRUE)`] would _not_ forward the state of the random number generator (RNG).  For example, if we generated random numbers in individuals futures this way, they would become _identical_, e.g.

```r
f <- future(rnorm(n = 1L), seed = TRUE)
value(f)
#> [1] -1.424997

f <- future(rnorm(n = 1L), seed = TRUE)
value(f)
#> [1] -1.424997
```

This was a deliberate, conservative design, because exactly how the RNG state should be forwarded is not obvious, especially if consider that random numbers may be generated also in the main R session.  The more you dig into the problem, the further down you end up in a rabit whole.  Because of this, I held back on addressing this problem and leaving it to the developer to solve it, i.e. they had to roll their own L'Ecuyer-CMRG RNG streams, and populate each future with a unique seed from the RNG substreams, i.e. `future(..., seed = <seed>)`. This is how it works in **[future.apply]** and **[furrr]**.

However, I understand that design was confusing, and if not understood, it could silently lead to RNG mistakes and correlated, and even identical random numbers.  I admit that also I got confused about this at times when I needed to do something quickly with individual futures and random numbers.  I even considered making `seed = TRUE` an error until resolved, and, looking back, maybe I should have done so.

Anyway, because it is rather tedious to roll your own  L'Ecuyer-CMRG RNG streams, I decided to have `future(..., seed = TRUE)` provide a good-enough solution internally, where it forwards the RNG state and then provides the future with an RNG substream based on the updated RNG state.  In **future** (>= 1.24.0), we now get:

```r
f <- future(rnorm(n = 1L), seed = TRUE)
v <- value(f)
print(v)
#> [1] -1.424997

f <- future(rnorm(n = 1L), seed = TRUE)
v <- value(f)
print(v)
#> [1] -1.985136
```

This update only affects code that currently uses `future(..., seed = TRUE)`.  It does _not_ affect code that rely on **future.apply** or **furrr**, which produces identical random numbers as before when using, for instance, `y <- future_lapply(..., future.seed = TRUE)`.


## Deprecating future strategies 'transparent' and 'remote'

It's on the roadmap to provide mechanisms for a future to be processed on a parallel backend that best can meet its resources requirements as specified by the develop.  In order to support this, we need to restrict the future backend API further, which is work that has been taking place over the last couple of years in collaboration with existing package developers.

In this release, I am formally deprecating future strategies `transparent` and `remote`.  If either are used, they now produce an informative warning. The `transparent` strategy is deprecated in favor of `sequential` with argument `split = TRUE` set. If you still use `remote`, please migrate to `cluster`, which can achieve everything that `remote` can do.

By the way, if you are still using `multiprocess`, which is deprecated in **future (>= 1.20.0) since 2020-11-03, please migrate to `multisession` so you won't get surprised when `multiprocess` becomes defunct.

Happy futuring!
