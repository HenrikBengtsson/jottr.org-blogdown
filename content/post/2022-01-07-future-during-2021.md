Happy New Year!  I made some updates to the future framework during
2021 that involves overall improvements and essential preparations to
go forward with some exciting new features that I'm keen to work on
during 2022.

The [future framework](https://futureverse.org) makes it easy to
parallelize existing R code - often with only a minor change of
code. The goal is to lower the barriers so that anyone can quickly and
safely speed up their existing R code in a worry-free manner.

**[future]** 1.22.1 was released in August 2021, followed by
**future** 1.23.0 at the end of October 2021.  Below, I summarize the
updates that came with those two releases:

 * [New features](#new-features)
 * [Performance improvements](#performance-improvements)
 * [Cleanups to make room for new features](#cleanups-to-make-room-for-new-features)
 * [Significant changes preparing for the future](#significant-changes-preparing-for-the-future)
 * [Roadmap ahead](#roadmap-ahead)
 
There were also several updates to the related **[parallelly]** and
**[progressr]** packages, which you can read about in earlier blog
posts under the [#parallelly](/tags/#parallelly-list) and
[#progressr](/tags/#progressr-list) blog tags.


## New features

### futureSessionInfo() for troubleshooting and issue reporting

Function [`futureSessionInfo()`] was added to **future** 1.22.0.  It
outputs information useful for troubleshooting problems related to the
future framework.  It also runs some basic tests to validate that the
current future backend works as expected.  If you have problems
getting futures to work on your machine, please run this function
before reporting issues at [Future Discussions].  Here's an example:

```r
> library(future)
> plan(multisession, workers = 2)
> futureSessionInfo()

### Working around UTF-8 escaping on MS Windows

Because of limitations in R itself, UTF-8 symbols outputted on MS
Windows parallel workers would be [relayed as escaped
symbols](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future/issues/473) when
using futures.  Now, the future framework, and, more specifically,
[`value()`], attempts to recover such MS Windows output to UTF-8
before outputting it.

For example, in **future** (< 1.23.0) you would get the following:

```r
f <- future({ cat("\u2713 Everything is OK") ; 42 })
v <- value(f)
#> <U+2713> Everything is OK
```

when, and only when, those futures are resolved on a MS Windows
machine.  In **future** (>= 1.23.0), we work around this problem by
looking for `<U+NNNN>` like patterns in the output and decode them as
UTF-8 symbols;

```r
f <- future({ cat("\u2713 Everything is OK") ; 42 })
v <- value(f)
#> âœ“ Everything is OK
```

_Comment_: From [R 4.2.0, R will have native support for UTF-8 also on
MS
Windows](https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2021/12/07/upcoming-changes-in-r-4.2-on-windows/index.html).
More testing and validation is needed to confirm this will work out of
the box in R (>= 4.2.0) when running R in the terminal, in the R GUI,
in the RStudio Console, and so on.  If so, **future** will be updated
to only apply this workaround for R (< 4.2.0).



### Harmonization of future(), futureAssign(), and futureCall()

Prior to **future** 1.22.0, argument `seed` for [`futureAssign()`] and
[`futureCall()`] defaulted to `TRUE`, whereas it defaulted to `FALSE`
for [`future()`].  This was an oversight.  In **future** (>= 1.22.0),
`seed = FALSE` is the default for all these functions.


### Protecting against non-exportable results

Analogously to how globals may be scanned for ["non-exportable"
objects](https://future.futureverse.org/articles/future-4-non-exportable-objects.html)
when option `future.globals.onReference` is set to `"error"` or
`"warning"`, `value()` will now check for similar problems in the
value returned from parallel workers.  For example, in **future** (<
1.23.0) we would get:

```r
library(future)
plan(multisession, workers = 2)
options(future.globals.onReference = "error")

f <- future(xml2::read_xml("<body></body>"))
v <- value(f)
print(v)
#> Error in doc_type(x) : external pointer is not valid
```

whereas in **future** (>= 1.23.0) we get:

```r
library(future)
plan(multisession, workers = 2)
options(future.globals.onReference = "error")

f <- future(xml2::read_xml("<body></body>"))
v <- value(f)
#> Error: Detected a non-exportable reference ('externalptr') in the value
#> (of class 'xml_document') of the resolved future
```


### Finer control of what type of conditions are captured and replayed

Besides specifying which condition classes to be captured and relayed,
in **future** (>= 1.22.0), it is possible to specify also condition
classes to be ignored.  For example,

```r
f <- future(..., conditions = structure("condition", exclude = "message"))
```

captures all conditions but message conditions.  The default is
`conditions = "condition"`, which captures and relays any type of
condition.



## Performance improvements

I always prioritize correctness over performance in the **future**
framework.  So, whenever optimizing for performance, one always has
to make sure we are not breaking things somewhere else.  Thankfully,
there are now [over 200 reverse-dependency packages on
CRAN](https://www.futureverse.org/statistics.html) and Bioconductor
that I can validate against.  They provide another comfy cushion
against mistakes than what we already get from package unit tests and
the **[future.tests]** test suite.  Below are some recent performance
improvements made.


### Less latency for multicore, multisession, and cluster futures

In **future** 1.22.0, the default timeout of [`resolved()`] was
decreased from 0.20 seconds to 0.01 seconds for multicore,
multisession, and cluster futures.  This means that less time is now
spent on checking for results from these future backends when they are
not yet available.  After making sure it is safe to do so, we might
decrease the default timeout to zero in a later release.


### Less overhead when initiating futures

The overhead of initiating futures was significantly reduced in
**future** 1.22.0.  For example, the round-trip time for
`value(future(NULL))` is about twice as fast for sequential, cluster,
and multisession futures.  For multicore futures the round-trip speedup
is about 20%.

The speedup comes from pre-compiling the future's R expression into an
R expression template, which then can quickly re-compiled into the
final expression to be evaluated. Specifically, instead of calling
`expr <- base::bquote(tmpl)` for each future, which is computationally
expensive, we take a two-step approach where we first call `tmpl_cmp
<- bquote_compile(tmpl)` once per session such that we only have to
call the much faster `expr <- bquote_apply(tmpl_cmp)` for each
future.(*) This new pre-compile approach speeds up the construction of
the final future expression from the original future expression ~10
times.

(*) These are [internal functions](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future/blob/1064c4ec2c37a70fa8fff8887d0030a5f03c46da/R/000.bquote.R#L56-L131) of the **future** package.


### Environment variables are only used when package is loaded

All R [options specific to the future
framework](https://future.futureverse.org/reference/future.options.html)
have defaults that fall back to corresponding environment variables.
For example, the default for option `future.rng.onMisuse` can be set
by environment variable `R_FUTURE_RNG_ONMISUSE`.

The purpose of the environment variables is to make it possible to
configure the future framework before launching R, e.g. in shell
startup scripts, or in shell scripts submitted to job schedulers in
high-performance compute (HPC) environments.  When R is already
running, the best practice is to use the R options to configure the
future framework.

In order to avoid the overhead from querying and parsing environment
variables at runtime, but also to clarify how and when environment
variables should be set, starting with **future** 1.22.0,
_`R_FUTURE_*` environment variables are only used when the **future**
package is loaded_.  Then, if set, they are used for setting the
corresponding `future.*` option.


## Cleanups to make room for new features

The `values()` function is defunct since **future** 1.23.0 in favor of
`value()`.  All CRAN and Bioconductor packages that depend on
**future** have been updated since a long time.  If you get the error:

```r
Error: values() is defunct in future (>= 1.20.0). Use value() instead.
```

make sure to update your R packages.  A few users of **[furrr]** have
run into this error - updating to **furrr** (>= 0.2.0) solved the
problem.


Continuing, to further harmonize how developers use the Future API, we
are moving away from odds-and-ends features, especially the ones that
are holding us back from adding new features. The goal is to ensure
that more code using futures can truly run anywhere, not just on a
particular parallel backend that the developer work with.

In this spirit, we are slowly moving away from "persistent" workers.
For example, in **future** (>= 1.23.0), `plan(multisession, persistent
= TRUE)` is no longer supported and will produce an error if
attempted.  The same will eventually happen also for `plan(cluster,
persistent = TRUE)`, but not until we have [support for caching
"sticky" globals](https://www.futureverse.org/roadmap.html), which is
the main use case for persistent workers.

Another example is transparent futures, which are prepared for
deprecation in **future** (>= 1.23.0).  If used, `plan(transparent)`
produces a warning, which soon will be upgraded to a formal
deprecation warning.  In a later release, it will produce an error.
Transparent futures were added during the early days in order to
simplify troubleshooting of futures.  A better approach these days is
to use `plan(sequential, split = TRUE)`, which makes interactive
troubleshooting tools such as `browser()` and `debug()` to work.



## Significant changes preparing for the future

Prior to **future** 1.22.0, lazy futures were assigned to the
currently set future backend immediately when created.  For example,
if we do:

```r
library(future)
plan(multisession, workers = 2)

f <- future(42, lazy = TRUE)
```

with **future** (< 1.22.0), we would get:

```r
class(f)
#> [1] "MultisessionFuture" "ClusterFuture"      "MultiprocessFuture"
#> [4] "Future"             "environment" 
```

Starting with **future** 1.22.0, lazy futures remain generic futures
until they are launched, which means they are not assigned a backend
class until they have to.  Now, the above example gives:

```r
class(f)
#> [1] "Future"      "environment"
```

This change opens up the door for storing futures themselves to file
and sending them elsewhere. More precisely, this means we can start
working towards a _queue of futures_, which then can be processed on
whatever compute resources we have access to at the moment, e.g. some
futures might be resolved on the local computer, others on machines on
a local cluster, and when those fill up, we can burst out to cloud
resources, or maybe process them via a community-driven peer-to-peer
cluster.


## Roadmap ahead

There are lots of new features on the roadmap related to the above and
other things.  I hope to make progress on several of them during 2022.
