**[progressr]** 0.8.0 is on CRAN.  It comes with some new features:

* A new 'rstudio' handler that reports on progress via the RStudio Job interface in RStudio

* `withProgressShiny()` now updates the `detail` part, instead of the `message` part

* In addition to signalling relative amount of progress, it's now also possible to signal total amount

If you're curious what **progressr** is about, have a look at my [e-Rum 2020 presentation](/2020/07/04/progressr-erum2020-slides/).


## Progress updates in RStudio's Job interface

If you're using RStudio Console, you can now report on progress in the RStudio's Job interface as long as the progress originates from a **progressr**-signalling function.  Iâ€™ve shown an example of this in Figure&nbsp;1.

<figure style="margin-top: 3ex;">

Figure 1: The RStudio Job interface can show progress bars. In this screenshot, we see a green progress bar at 30% that has run for 0:03 (seconds) with a title to the left saying 'Console 05:50:51 PM' showing when the progress started.
</figcaption>
</figure>

To try this yourself, run the below in the RStudio Console.

```r
library(progressr)
handlers(global = TRUE)
handlers("rstudio")
y <- slow_sum(1:10)
```

The progress bar disappears when the calculation completes.





## Tweaks to withProgressShiny()

The `withProgressShiny()` function, which is a **progressr**-aware version of `withProgress()`, gained argument `inputs`.  It defaults to `inputs = list(message = NULL, detail = "message")`, which says that a progress message should update the 'detail' part of the Shiny progress panel.  For example,

```r
X <- 1:10
withProgressShiny(message = "Calculation in progress",
                  detail = "Starting ...",
                  value = 0, {
  p <- progressor(along = X)
  y <- lapply(X, FUN=function(x) {
    Sys.sleep(0.25)
    p(sprintf("x=%d", x))
  })
})
```

will start out as in the left panel of Figure&nbsp;2, and, as soon as the first progress signal is received, the 'detail' part is updated with `x=1` as shown in the right panel.

</figure>


Prior to this new release, the default behavior was to update the 'message' part of the Shiny progress panel.  To revert to the old behavior, set argument `inputs` as in:

```r
X <- 1:10
withProgressShiny(message = "Starting ...",
                  detail = "Calculation in progress",
                  value = 0, {
  p <- progressor(along = X)
  y <- lapply(X, FUN=function(x) {
    Sys.sleep(0.25)
    p(sprintf("x=%d", x))
  })
}, inputs = list(message = "message", detail = NULL))
```

This results in what you see in Figure&nbsp;3.  I think that the new behavior, as shown in Figure&nbsp;2, makes more sense, which is why I changed the default behavior.

## Update to a specific amount of total progress

When using **progressr**, we start out by creating a progressor function that we then call to signal progress.  For example, if we do:

```r
my_slow_fun <- function() {
  p <- progressr::progressor(steps = 10)
  count <- 0
  for (i in 1:10) {
    count <- count + 1
    p(sprintf("count=%d", count))
  }
  count
})
```

each call to `p()` corresponds to `p(amount = 1)`, which signals that our function have moved `amount = 1` steps closer to the total amount `steps = 10`.  We can take smaller or bigger steps by specifying another `amount`.

In this new version, I've introduced a new beta feature that allows us to signal progress that says where we are in _absolute terms_.  With this, we can do things like:

```r
my_slow_fun <- function() {
  p <- progressr::progressor(steps = 10)
  count <- 0
  for (i in 1:5) {
    count <- count + 1
    if (runif(1) < 0.5) break
    Sys.sleep(2)
    p(sprintf("count=%d", count))
  }
  ## In case we broke out of the loop early,
  ## make sure to update 5/10 progress
  p(step = 5)
  for (i in 1:5) {
    count <- count + 1
    Sys.sleep(2)
    p(sprintf("count=%d", count))
  }
  count
}
```

When calling `my_slow_fun()`, we might see progress being reported as:

```
- [--------------------------------------------------------------------]   0% 
\ [=====>-------------------------------------------------------]  10% count=1
| [===========>-------------------------------------------------]  20% count=2
\ [=============================>-------------------------------]  50% count=3
...
```

Note how it took a leap from 20% to 50% when `count == 2`.  If we run it another again, the move to 50% might happen at another iteration.


## Wrapping up

There are also a few bug fixes, which you can read about in [NEWS](https://progressr.futureverse.org/news/index.html).  And a usual, all of this work also when you run in parallel using the [future framework](https://futureverse.org).

Make progress!
