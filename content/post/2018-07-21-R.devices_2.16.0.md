[R.devices] 2.16.0 - _Unified Handling of Graphics Devices_ - is on CRAN.  With this release, you can now easily **suppress unwanted graphics**, e.g. graphics produced by one of those do-everything-in-one-call functions that we all bump into once in a while.  To suppress graphics, the **R.devices** package provides graphics device `nulldev()`, and function `suppressGraphics()`, which both send any produced graphics into the void.  This works on all operating systems, including Windows.

## Examples

```r
library(R.devices)
nulldev()
plot(1:100, main = "Some Ignored Graphics")
dev.off()
```

```r
R.devices::suppressGraphics({
  plot(1:100, main = "Some Ignored Graphics")
})
```


## Other Features

Some other reasons for using the **R.devices** package:

* **No need to call dev.off()** - Did you ever forgot to call `dev.off()`, or did a function call produce an error causing `dev.off()` not to be reached, leaving a graphics device open?  By using one of the `toPDF()`, `toPNG()`, ... functions, or the more general `devEval()` function, `dev.off()` is automatically taken care of.

* **No need to specify filename extension** - Did you ever switch from using `png()` to, say, `pdf()`, and forgot to update the filename resulting in a `my_plot.png` file that is actually a PDF file?  By using one of the `toPDF()`, `toPNG()`, ... functions, or the more general `devEval()` function, filename extensions are automatically taken care of - just specify the part without the extension.

* **Specify the aspect ratio** - rather than having to manually calculate device-specific arguments `width` or `height`, e.g. `toPNG("my_plot", { plot(1:10) }, aspectRatio = 2/3)`.  This is particularly useful when switching between device types, or when outputting to multiple ones at the same time.

* **Unified API for graphics options** - conveniently set (most) graphics options including those that can otherwise only be controlled via arguments, e.g. `devOptions("png", width = 1024)`.

* **Control where figure files are saved** - the default is folder `figures/` but can be set per device type or globally, e.g. `devOptions("*", path = "figures/col/")`.

* **Easily produce EPS and favicons** - `toEPS()` and `toFavicon()` are friendly wrappers for producing EPS and favicon graphics.

* **Capture and replay graphics** - for instance, use `future::plan(remote, workers = "remote.server.org"); p %<-% capturePlot({ plot(1:10) })` to produce graphics on a remote machine, and then display it locally by printing `p`.

```r
R.devices::toPDF("my_plot", {
  plot(1:100, main = "Amazing Graphics")
})
### [1] "figures/my_plot.pdf"
```

```r
R.devices::toPNG("my_plot", {
  plot(1:100, main = "Amazing Graphics")
})
### [1] "figures/my_plot.png"
```

```r
R.devices::toEPS("my_plot", {
  plot(1:100, main = "Amazing Graphics")
})
### [1] "figures/my_plot.eps"
```

```r
R.devices::devEval(c("png", "pdf", "eps"), name = "my_plot", {
  plot(1:100, main = "Amazing Graphics")
}, aspectRatio = 1.3)
### $png
