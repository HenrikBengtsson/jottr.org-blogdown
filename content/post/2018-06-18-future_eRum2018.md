As promised - though a bit delayed - below are links to my slides and the video of my talk on _Future: Parallel & Distributed Processing in R for Everyone_ that I presented last month at the [eRum 2018](https://2018.erum.io/) conference in Budapest, Hungary (May 14-16, 2018).

The conference was very well organized (thank you everyone involved) with a great lineup of several brilliant workshop sessions, talks, and poster presentations (thanks all).  It was such a pleasure to attend this conference and to connect and reconnect with so many of the lovely people that we are fortunate to have in the R Community.  I'm looking forward to meeting you all again.


My talk (22 slides plus several appendix slides):

* Title: _Future: Parallel & Distributed Processing in R for Everyone_
* [HTML](https://www.jottr.org/presentations/eRum2018/BengtssonH_20180516-eRum2018.html) (incremental slides; requires online access)
* [PDF](https://www.jottr.org/presentations/eRum2018/BengtssonH_20180516-eRum2018.pdf) (flat slides)
* [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doa7avxbptQ) (22 mins)



May the future be with you!
