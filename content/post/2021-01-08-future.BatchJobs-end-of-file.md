This is an announcement that **[future.BatchJobs]** - _A Future API for Parallel and Distributed Processing using BatchJobs_ has been archived on CRAN.  The package has been deprecated for years with a recommendation of using **[future.batchtools]** instead.  The latter has been on CRAN since June 2017 and builds upon the **[batchtools]** package, which itself supersedes the **[BatchJobs]** package.

To wrap up the three-and-a-half year long life of **[future.BatchJobs]**, the very last version, 0.17.0, reached CRAN on 2021-01-04 and passed on CRAN checks as of 2020-01-08, when the the package was requested to be formally archived.  All versions ever existing on CRAN can be found at <https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/future.BatchJobs/>.


## Postscript

The <https://cran.r-project.org/package=future.BatchJobs> page mentions:

> Archived on 2021-01-08 at the request of the maintainer.
>
> Consider using package ‘[future.batchtools]’ instead.

I'm happy to see that we can suggest another package on our archived package pages.  All I did to get this was to mention it in my email to CRAN:

> Hi,
> 
> please archive the 'future.BatchJobs' package. It has zero reverse dependencies.
> The package has been labelled deprecated for a long time now and has been superseded by the 'future.batchtools' package.
>
> Thank you,  
> Henrik
