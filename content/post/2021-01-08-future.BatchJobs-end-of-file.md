This is an announcement that **[future.BatchJobs]** - _A Future API for Parallel and Distributed Processing using BatchJobs_ has been archived on CRAN.  The package has been deprecated for years with a recommendation of using **[future.batchtools]** instead.  The latter has been on CRAN since June 2017 and builds upon the **[batchtools]** package, which itself replaces the **[BatchJobs]** package.

To wrap up the three-and-a-half year long life of **[future.BatchJobs]**, the very last version, 0.17.0, reached CRAN on 2021-01-04 and passed on CRAN checks as of 2020-01-08, when the the package was requested to be formally archived.  All versions ever existing on CRAN can be found at <https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/future.BatchJobs/>.
