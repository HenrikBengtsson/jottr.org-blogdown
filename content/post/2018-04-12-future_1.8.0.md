**[future]** 1.8.0 is available on CRAN.

This release lays the foundation for being able to capture outputs from futures, perform automated timing and memory benchmarking (profiling) on futures, and more.  These features are _not_ yet available out of the box, but thanks to this release we will be able to make some headway on many of [the feature requests related to this](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future/issues/172) - hopefully already by the next release.

!["A Shiny Future"](https://jottr-draft.netlify.com/post/retro-shiny-future-small.png)

For **shiny** users following Joe Cheng's efforts on extending [Shiny with asynchronous processing using futures](https://rstudio.github.io/promises/articles/shiny.html), **future** 1.8.0 comes with some [important updates/bug fixes](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future/issues/200) that allow for consistent error handling regardless whether Shiny runs with or without futures and regardless of the future backend used.  With previous versions of the **future** package, you would receive errors of different classes depending on which future backend was used.

The `future_lapply()` function was moved to the **[future.apply]** package back in January 2018.  Please use that one instead, especially since the one in the **future** package is now formally deprecated (and produces a warning if used).  In **future.apply** there is also a `future_sapply()` function and hopefully, in a not too far future, we'll see additional futurized versions of other base R apply functions, e.g. `future_vapply()` and `future_apply()`.

Finally, with this release, there was an bug fix related to _nested futures_ (where you call `future()` within a `future()` - or use `%<-%` within another `%<-%`).  When using non-standard evaluation (NSE) such as **dplyr** expressions in a nested future, you could get a false error that complained about not being able to identify a global variable when it actually was a column in a data.frame.



## What's next?

* I'm giving a presentation on futures at the [eRum 2018 conference taking place on May 14-16, 2018 in Budapest](https://2018.erum.io/). I'm excited about this opportunity and to meet more folks in the European R community.

* I'm happy to announce that The Infrastructure Steering Committee of The R Consortium is funding the project [Future Minimal API: Specification with Backend Conformance Test Suite](https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/awarded-projects).  I'm grateful for their support.  The aim is to formalize the Future API further and to provide a standardized test suite that packages implementing future backends can validate their implementations against.  This will benefit the quality of higher-level parallel frameworks that utilize futures internally, e.g. **[future.apply]** and **foreach** with **[doFuture]**. It will also help moving forward on several of [the feature requests received from the community](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future/issues/172).  


## Help shape the future

If you find futures useful in your R-related work, please consider sharing your stories, e.g. by blogging, on [Twitter], or on [GitHub]. It always exciting to hear about how people are using them or how they'd like to use. I know there are so many great ideas out there!

Happy futuring!
